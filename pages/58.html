				<div class="prop-title">Summary</div>
				<div class="prop-text">This is a surprisingly interesting issue. It comes down to the pedagogical question <em>How should students, who are not fluent in English, learn English?</em><br><br>To understand this measure, there's some history to recount. Before 1998, if you were a student who spoke Spanish at home, you might get put into a Spanish-only classroom, and go through school without learning English. That's no bueno, because the colleges and employers you could choose from would be extremely limited. (And, nearly all parents want their children to learn English<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>) So in 1998, <a target="_blank" href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_227,_the_%22English_in_Public_Schools%22_Initiative_(1998)">Prop 227</a> was passed statewide to make sure students learned English by making it very difficult to be taught in a bilingual setting. As a Spanish student, unless you had a waiver, you were put into English-only classrooms â€“ meaning the teacher would speak nearly 100% in English. After ten years, bilingual classrooms had all but disappeared.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup><br><br>It's now the distant future, 2016, and the Legislature has recommended to the ballot Prop 58 â€“ what you're voting on â€“Â to repeal the key parts of Prop 227 and essentially allows local communities to decide how to teach English-learners, whether it's English-only, bilingual, or other variations.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>

				<div class="prop-title">Did Prop 227 work?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">Hard to say with certainty. Opponents cite the success of Prop 227 in test scores<sup><a href="#9">[9]</a></sup>, which have increased. The percentage of English-learners scoring "proficient" or "advanced" (the top two categories) in reading and writing doubled from 2003 to 2009. They contend that kids absorb language effortlessly, and immersion is the best way to do so.<br><br>Proponents of 58 say the data is conflated with national requirements like No Child Left Behind, and in general, students' scores all increased.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup> A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.air.org/project/evaluation-proposition-227">study</a>, mandated by the state and published in 2006, says the data cannot unambiguously conclude that one way to teach English is better than the other. However, with the data they did have, they found no difference in effectiveness between immersion and bilingual programs.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup><br><br>Proponents also talk about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/researchbrief/v2n05/toc.aspx">research</a> from 2004 on how to best implement bilingual programs, but these strategies are not possible under Prop 227. Passing Prop 58 would give schools and local communities flexibility.
				<br><br>
				This is an important vote. It affects 1 in 5 students, of which 80% speak Spanish. That's <em>1.4 million</em> students who aren't fluent in English.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup></div>
