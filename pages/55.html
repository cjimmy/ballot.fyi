				<div class="prop-text">
				In 2012, voters approved Prop 30, which included a marginal tax rate increase of 1-3% on those making more than $263,000 a year (higher for couples, obviously). This also includes any small business that pays personal income tax instead of the state business tax. This tax is effective until 2018, but if passed, Prop 55 (the thing you're voting on) would extend the tax until 2030. By then, we expect President Trump won't have us paying taxes at all.<sup><a href="">[jk]</a></sup>

				<div class="prop-text">
				When people voted on Prop 30, voters were told that the tax would be "temporary," to alleviate the rainy day that was the recession. Here's the exact text from Prop 30, in 2012: "<em>The new taxes in this measure are temporary. Under the California Constitution the 1/4-cent sales tax increase expires in four years, and the income tax increases for the wealthiest taxpayers end in seven years.</em>" Opponents argue that the tax was necessary in 2012, and now that things are a-okay again, we should no longer continue it.
				<br><br>
				Even though it's easy to just think about yourself in this case, it's important to consider what the greater effects are, and if this is good for the overall state system. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Chronicle-recommends-No-on-state-Prop-55-9211163.php">The San Francisco Chronicle</a> opposes the measure because we shouldn't be supporting the education system from income tax, but rather sales tax. Revenue from income tax is dependent on the economy.

Assuming you weren't already going to, you might consider supporting this tax extension by reading about where the money is going and to keep in mind that your taxes won't be raised ‚Äì but they won't be lowered back to pre-2012 rates either. In short, of the estimated $4 billion to $9 billion extra revenue expected, half will be spent on schools and community colleges, with the remaining half split between Medi-Cal and budget reserves in a TBD way.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> As some papers argue, this is not the best solution, but lack of funding is worse.<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup>
