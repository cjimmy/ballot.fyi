				<div class="prop-text">We previously wrote this was straight-forward. It appears that's not the case. This measure would require that bills be put in print (like, paper) and online 72 hours before the state Legislature can vote on it. It also requires that all public proceedings be recorded and put online within 24 hours. Crazy, right? Not so fast.

				<div class="prop-title">Tell me more.</div>
				<div class="prop-text">The measure would amend the state constitution. Its stated intention is to prevent bills from being changed last-minute by special interest groups and then ratified, but special interest groups are supporting this proposition. Those who oppose this proposition say it'll do the opposite of its intention, that bills and legislators will become <em>more</em> likely to be influenced by special interest groups by giving them 72 hours to intervene.<sup><a src="#7">[7]</a></sup> Proponents say this is common-sense transparency; opponents see a monkey wrench thrown into the flow of legislation. The Legislature generally debates bills for months, in which it is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/the_state_legislature/bill_information/bill_information.html">open</a> to the public, and many proceedings are already available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calchannel.com/video-on-demand/">online</a> by demand. Any change, including a typo or missing comma, would require another 72 hours.
				<br><br>P.S. In the case the Governor declares a state of emergency, this 72 hour delay can be waived by a two-thirds vote.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup></div>
