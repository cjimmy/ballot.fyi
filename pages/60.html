				<div class="prop-text">If used, condoms would provide greater protection against HIV and other STIs. As you might expect, the porn industry is <em>vigorously</em> opposed, saying their current testing practices are just fine, and condom requirements will further drive the industry to other states or even underground.<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> Proponents cite the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23191956">rampant</a> chlamydia and gonorrhea among performers, and that this is already law, but  not properly enforced because of loopholes.
				<br><br> Surpisingly both the CA Democratic Party and the CA Republic Party are opposed to the measure, as well as the SF AIDS Foundation and <a href="https://aplahealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/APLA-Health-Condoms-in-Portn-Statement.pdf">AIDS Project LA</a>.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> Many publications express that the measure is excessive, saying it will give Californians too much legal power, and Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation too much power. On the other side, sexual health groups and occupational safety groups support condom use in porns.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.voteyesprop60.com/endorsements/">[..]</a></sup></div>
				
				<div class="prop-title">Why is this even on the ballot?</div>
				<div class="prop-text"><span id='calosha' data-expanded='California Occupational Safety and Health' class="acronym">Cal/OSHA</span> (the workplace safety folks) already require that, in general, a worker be protected from blood-borne pathogens, but when it comes to porn, Cal/OSHA has only enforced complaints, and they also recently <a target="_blank" href="https://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/02/17/california-porn-industry-protests-rules-mandating-condoms/">rejected</a> a regulation similar to Prop 60, creating specific additional regulations around porn. This regulation was proposed by the same people who wrote Prop 60, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. <br><br>LA already has a condom requirement, (ironically, we hope) called Measure B, created by the same AIDS Healthcare Foundation.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> In an effort to make it statewide, they proposed a bill similar to Prop 60 that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140814/condom-bill-dies-in-key-california-committee-porn-industry-satisfied-x2014-for-now">failed</a> in the state Senate in 2014. Now it's on the ballot, and up to you to decide.</div>
