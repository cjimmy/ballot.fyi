				<div class="prop-title text-center">Summary</div>
				<div class="prop-text">This proposition is a few different pieces that create more checks during the sale of ammunition. California already has the strictest gun laws in effect (a bunch were passed earlier this year in what critics called "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/08/28/second-amendment-backers-arm-up-with-ink-and-paper-to-battle-californias-gunmageddon.html">Gunmageddon</a>" – super creative.) so we'll present how it is now, and what would be different should Prop 63 pass. Spoiler alert: it's kinda not much.</div>

					<ul>
						<li>To buy ammunition right now, you don't need a permit, but the dealers need to check with the <span class="acronym" id='doj1' data-expanded="Department of Justice">DoJ</span> to make sure you're okay to buy it.</li>
						<li>To sell ammunition, you currently have to get a 1-year license. Hunters selling 50 rounds or less a month are exempt.</li>
						<li>"Gunmageddon" set into law that if you buy ammunition from out of state, you'll have to have it delivered to a licensed vendor so that you can pick it up in person. This goes into effect in July 2019.</li>
						<li>Because of another law, if a gun is stolen and worth less than $950, it's currently a misdemeanor.</li>
						<li>It's been illegal to purchase large-capacity magazines (more than 10 rounds) since the year 2000, but if you owned some, you could keep it.</li>
						<li>At the moment, it's difficult to enforce the removal of firearms from prohibited people.<sup><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup></li>

				<div class="prop-text">
					<ul>
						<li>If you want to buy ammo, you would now have to pass a background check through the <span class="acronym" id='doj2' data-expanded="Department of Justice">DoJ</span> and buy a 4-year permit that could cost $50 max.</li>
						<li>Selling ammo without a license would now become a misdemeanor. Hunters selling 50 rounds or less a month are still exempt.</li>
						<li>Prop 63 would still require online purchases to be delivered to a licensed dealer and picked up in person, but it would move up the date it goes into effect to January 2018.</li>
						<li>If Prop 63 passes, if a gun is stolen and worth less than $950, it would now be a felony.</li>
						<li>If you happen to still own large-capacity magazines, you would have to dispose of them.</li>
						<li>A court process would be set up to enforce the removal of guns from prohibited people (convicted of felonies, assault, or battery; dangerous due to mental illness; or have a restraining order against them).<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup></li>

						Gun laws became super <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/01/484399958/6-new-gun-control-laws-enacted-in-california-as-gov-brown-signs-bills">strict</a> earlier this year in July. Prop 63 modifies those laws to make them stricter. Most of these laws don't go into effect until later, and it's possible there might be a referendum to block the new laws. <br><br>For gun owners, the largest change is the requirement to buy a permit in order to purchase ammo. It could cost up to $50 and will take time to process the request.
