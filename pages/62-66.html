				<div class="prop-text">Let's start with some interesting things. First, of the 930 people who've been sentenced to death since 1978, when the law was enacted, only 15 have been executed. The last time somebody in California was executed was over ten years ago, in 2006.<br><br>Why is it so difficult to execute someone? Well, this is where it gets complex. There are (at least) three sub-problems, not independent of each other, but we'll present them as such.
				<br><br>Let's just pretend that you've been convicted of first-degree murder and were also sentenced to death. Spoiler alert: it will probably take decades before you're executed.
