				<div class="prop-text">This proposition, whether it passes or fails, has <em>no legal effect</em> on anything.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> It is purely an <a target="_blank" href="https://ballotpedia.org/Advisory_question">advisory</a> measure, advising California's elected officials to use their authority to try to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling of <em>Citizens United v Federal Election Commission</em> â€“Â a ruling that, as liberals put it, allows unlimited political spending by corporations. As the right would put it, it protects free speech against government â€“ an essential part of democracy â€“Â by protecting how you spend money to communicate. A <em>yes</em> on 59 tells the government you want it to use its authority to propose an amendment to the US Constitution overturning Citizens United. A <em>no</em> on 59 tells them, "Nah, it's cool."

				<div class="prop-title">What's Citizens United?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">Okay, so let's ignore the fact that your vote on this proposition literally does nothing legally, regardless of whether it passes or fails.<br><br>Should you care about Citizens United? Probably â€“ it's a hot-button issue. In 2010, the US Supreme Court <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">ruled</a> that spending limits of corporations are unconstitutional because it limits how they can communicate, thus limiting the First Amendment. Spending limits do not apply as long as the contribution is not directly to a candidate, or the political cause that got the donation does not coordinate with the candidate.<br><br>The left would argue that this means groups can contribute unfair amounts of money to politics, making politics more influenced by the wealthy. Ultimately, this did lead to the creation of Super <a class="acronym" data-expanded='Political Action Committees' id='pacs' href="">PACs</a>. The right would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-arguments-in-support-of-Citizens-United">argue</a> that it's not a democracy if we limit spending because spreading a message is inherently tied to money spent.
				</div>
				<div class="prop-title">How are they going to overturn SCOTUS?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">The only way to overturn a <a href="" class="acronym" id='scotus' data-expanded="Supreme Court of the United States">SCOTUS</a> ruling is by either <br><ul><li>SCOTUS overruling itself in a future case</li> <li>Congress ratifying a Consitutional amendment</li><li>At least 38 states approve a Constitutional amendment<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup></li></ul>All are very difficult and unlikely, but if Prop 59 passes, then California elected officials might try to reverse it. How, exactly? Unclear what exactly they would propose should this pass.<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup></div>
				<div class="prop-title">Why is this even on the ballot?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">These kind of measures (i.e. non-binding advisory measures) are put on the ballot as a way to galvanize a certain a party to get people out to vote.<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup> Meta-arguments have arisen to not support the measure to show that these types of propositions should not clutter the ballot. At the end of the day, your vote on Prop 59 is purely symbolic.</div>
