				<div class="prop-text">This proposition, whether it passes or fails, has <em>no legal effect</em>.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> It is purely an <a target="_blank" href="https://ballotpedia.org/Advisory_question">advisory</a> measure, or "voter instruction," advising California's elected officials to use their authority to try to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling of <em>Citizens United v Federal Election Commission</em> ‚Äì¬†a ruling that, as liberals put it, allows unlimited political spending by corporations. As conservatives would put it, it protects free speech against government ‚Äì an essential part of democracy ‚Äì¬†by protecting how money is spent to communicate. A <em>yes</em> on 59 tells the state government you want it to use its authority to propose an amendment to the US Constitution overturning Citizens United. A <em>no</em> on 59 tells them, "Nah, it's cool."

				<div class="prop-title">What's Citizens United?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">Okay, so let's ignore the fact that your vote on this proposition literally does nothing legally, regardless of whether it passes or fails.<br><br>Should you care about Citizens United? Probably ‚Äì it's a hot-button issue. In 2010, the US Supreme Court <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">ruled</a> that spending limits of corporations are unconstitutional because it limits how they can communicate, thus limiting the First Amendment. Spending limits do not apply as long as the contribution is not directly to a candidate, or the political cause that got the donation does not coordinate with the candidate. But that doesn't stop them from directly supporting a candidate through ads, campaigns, etc.<br><br>The left would argue that this means groups can contribute unfair amounts of money to politics, making politics more influenced by whoever has money. Ultimately, this did lead to the creation of Super <a class="acronym" data-expanded='Political Action Committees' id='pacs' href="">PACs</a>, groups that can spend unlimited amounts of money on politcal campaigns, and do not have to disclose donors. The right would <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/20/citizens-united-misunderstood-five-years-free-speech-anniversary-critics-column/22076597/">argue</a> that it's actually leveled the playing field, allowing smaller groups to speak up, and the left has benefitted more from this it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/blue-billionaires-on-top-114151">seems</a>. A lot can be argued on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-arguments-in-support-of-Citizens-United">both</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/opinion/is-there-a-silver-lining-to-citizens-united.html">sides</a>
				</div>
				<div class="prop-title">How are they going to overturn SCOTUS?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">It's not specified what exactly legislators would propose should Prop 59 pass, but there are the three ways overturn a <a href="" class="acronym" id='scotus' data-expanded="Supreme Court of the United States">SCOTUS</a> ruling:<br><ul>
				<li>Congress ratifying a Consitutional amendment.</li>
				<li>At least 38 states approve a Constitutional amendment.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup></li>
				<li>SCOTUS overruling itself in a future case.</li> 
				</ul>
				All are very difficult and unlikely ‚Äì the only time 38 states got together was to repeal Prohibition.<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup></div>
				<div class="prop-title">Why is this even on the ballot?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">These kind of measures (i.e. non-binding advisory measures) are sometimes put on the ballot as a way to galvanize a certain a party to get people out to vote.<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup> Meta-arguments have arisen to not support the measure to show that these types of propositions should not clutter the ballot. But after 4 years of intense legal battles,<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> it's on the ballot.</div>
