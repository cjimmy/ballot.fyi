				<div class="prop-text">If passed, the state would give $9 billion in <em>general obligation bonds</em> (i.e. debts paid back with interest, paid by tax-payers) for school construction projects. $7B for K-12 public schools. $2B for community colleges.

				<div class="prop-title">Cool, why would anyone not want this?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">The debate is not about whether schools should get money. Many schools are in disrepair and there hasn't been a bond approved since 2006.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>  Opponents, including Gov. Jerry Brown, oppose the prop because it adds $500M of debt every year to the budget, it seems to bank roll construction companies, and it won't go to the neediest school districts.<sup><a href="#10">[10]</a></sup> He says the legislature can make a better proposal. Supporters point out that schools really need it right now. Opponents counter that school population is declining, and this is not the most urgent thing on the budget.<sup><a href="#11">[11]</a></sup></div>
				<div class="prop-title">Why is this even on the ballot?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">The state legislature tried to put a similar act on the ballot in 2014, but Gov. Jerry Brown opposed it. This proposition was created by a group made up of school districts and construction groups to bypass the state government and get money to school construction projects in need.<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup></div>
