				<div class="prop-title">Summary</div>
				<div class="prop-text">This legalizes, for people 21 and over, recreational marijuana sale and use, with taxation and regulation. There's plenty of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=64&year=2016">details</a> on what's legal and illegal, so we'll break it down for you and then get into the debate of it.
				</div>
				
				<div class="prop-subtitle">Growing</div>
				<div class="prop-text">
				<ul>
					<li>It's legal to grow up to 6 plants in a private home. Illegal if it is unlocked or visible from a public place.</li>
					<li>If being sold, the cultivation is taxed at $9.25/oz of dried flowers, or $2.75/oz of dried leaves.</li>
				</ul>
				</div> 	

				<div class="prop-subtitle">Selling &amp; purchasing</div>
				<div class="prop-text">
				<ul>
					<li>Businesses and delivery services (yes, delivery services) would need to be state-licensed, including existing medical marijuana collectives.</li>
					<li>Businesses that sell weed wouldn't be able to sell tobacco or alcohol, and can't be located near children-y places like schools or day-care centers.</li>
					<li>Edibles may not be in the form of a food that could be easily confused with another or appealing to children, like gummy bears and maybe brownies (TBD!).</li>
					<li>Businesses could have on-site weed consumption, but cannot do it in public sight.</li>
					<li>At point of sale, customer is taxed 15% on any non-medical marijuana products.</li>
					<li>Counties and cities could impose their own taxes and restrictions (except ban it), like their own licenses or where businesses could open up.</li>
					<li>Several different regulatory agencies would now regulate distribution, water usage, testing, pesticide use, envrionmental impact, labelling, packaging, and advertising, to name a few.</li>
				</ul>
				</div> 

				<div class="prop-subtitle">Using</div>
				<div class="prop-text">
				<ul>
					<li>Smoking is a-okay in a private home or at a business licensed for on-site consumption.</li>
					<li>Smoking is illegal while driving, in any public place, or anywhere where smoking tobacco is already prohibited (e.g. restaurants, bars, planes, etc).</li>

						I feel morally conflicted.

						What's wrong?

					<div class="clear"></div>
				    <div class="from-them">
				     	I'm voting for prop 56, the cigarette tax, but I want to vote for weed legalization.
				    </div>
				    <div class="from-me">
				     	Because you're stopping tobacco, but allowing marijuana? They're very different drugs.
				    </div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				    <div class="from-them">
						 I want to tell myself that, but Prop 64 is all about the business of marijuana. We're making another sin industry.
				    </div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				    <div class="from-me">
					    Unlike tobacco, it's not nicotine. Not addictive, and there's other ways to consume it.
				    </div>
				   <div class="clear"></div>
				    <div class="from-them">
						Forget about adults for a second. I wouldn't want my kids smoking or eating weed until they're well past Stanford, just like I wouldn't want them smoking cigarettes.
				    </div>
				    <div class="from-them">
						There's a lot of studies that say that until the brain matures at 25, pot could affect brain development, structurally and functionally.

				  <div class="clear"></div>
				    <div class="from-me">
					    That's already a problem though. Kids in Marin can get pot easier than they can get alcohol. Prop 64 would regulate it. Colorado has not seen an increase in youth use.

				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-them">But that might be because access is already so easy.</div>
				    <div class="prop-chat-source source-left"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/data/15data/15drfig3.pdf">[..]</a></div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-me">If we educate them right, though. It's estimated to bring in $1 billion dollars a year eventually. A portion of that will go to education.</div>
				    <div class="prop-chat-source source-right"><a href="#3">[3]</a></div>
				  <div class="from-me">Also, think about all the other negatives we'll be eliminating.</div>
				  <div class="from-me">Drug crimes often disproportionately affect black and Latino men, and lower socioeconomic people.</div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-them">That's great. But Prop 47 from a while ago already reduced the prison population for non-violent, non-serious drug offenses. Less than 0.3% of the prison population is in because of drugs, and that's probably drugs + something else.</div>

				  <div class="from-them">Also, in Colorado, arrests have declined, but racial disparities has not been solved.</div>
				    <div class="prop-chat-source source-left"><a href="#10">[10]</a></div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-me">It's only been two years. Look at all these other decreases in bad things: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/reports/marijuana_impacts_2015.pdf">http://www.ofm.wa.gov/reports/marijuana_impacts_2015.pdf</a></div>

				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-them">What about driving though? Have you ever driven high?</div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-me">Yea, I'm a pro. With traffic the way it is right now, you can't go over 30mph on the highway anyways.</div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-them">In Washington, car crash fatalities have increased after legalization. This includes THC + alcohol, and THC only.</div>
				    <div class="prop-chat-source source-left"><a target="_blank" href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2016/05/fatal-road-crashes-involving-marijuana-double-state-legalizes-drug/">[..]</a></div>

				  <div class="from-them">No FDA-approved breathalyzer yet too, and everybody knows it. The taboo for high driving isn't as strong as drunk driving.</div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-me">Legalizing it will speed up breathalyzer development and educate people about driving high. Like Colorado, we already have a high usage and access. Legalization will cut the black-market, and impose the laws we want to see.</div>
				  <div class="from-me">Until we do that, we can't do anything about current usage.</div>
				  <div class="clear"></div>
				  <div class="from-them">I still don't think we're ready for it. UCSF says this will just lead to Big Weed, not unlike Big Tobacco.</div>
