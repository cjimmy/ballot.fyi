				<div class="prop-text">Prop 67 asks voters to decide once and for all whether there should be a statewide ban on plastic bags. A Yes ratifies a ban that was passed by the state legislature in 2014 (aka SB270). A No overturns it.<br><br>Prop 65 decides where the bag fee goes ‚Äî at both the state and local level. Instead of allowing grocers to keep the 10 cents you pay per bag, that money goes into a yet-to-established statewide environmental fund. A Yes diverts money from grocers. A No allows grocers to keep the dime.<br><br>But because life is hard, there's a teeny clause in 65 that might cause problems for 67. <em>Dun dun dun!</em></div>

				<div class="prop-title">What's Prop 65?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">
				Prop 65 redirects the bag fees to an environmental fund. Under SB270 and local laws, grocers themselves are allowed to keep the proceeds of the bag fees to cover the cost of providing those bags, as well as to educate consumers about the benefits of using recyclable bags. Prop 65 would instead require all that money, from both local and state bans, to go to the <em>Environmental Protection and Enhancement Fund</em>, whose money would go to environmental protection and cleanup efforts, and would be managed by the Wildlife Conservation Fund.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> <br><br>
				Notably, the American Progressive Bag Alliance, an industry group representing plastic bag manufacturers, put up both Prop 67 and 65. (Hint: they don't want a plastic bag ban.) Some argue that the intention is to confuse voters.<sup><a href="#9">[9]</a></sup> 
				<br><br>
				The California Grocers Association, on the other hand, supports enacting a plastic bag ban,<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cagrocers.com/communications/publications/california-grocer/presidents-message/">[..]</a></sup>but do not support Prop 65, and support for the ban diminishes if they can't keep the proceeds from the bag fee.

				<div class="prop-title">And if both 65 and 67 pass?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">
				If Prop 67 passes, plastic bags are banned and grocers charge 10 cents per paper bag. If 65 passes, an environmental fund gets those 10 cents. However, if both pass and 65 ends up with <em>more</em> Yes votes than 67, then a clause could make things weird.
				<br><br>
				Prop 65, Section 6 reads in part: ‚ÄúIn the event that this measure receives a greater number of affirmative votes, the provisions of this measure shall prevail in their entirety, <em>and the provisions of the other measure or measures shall be null and void</em>.‚Äù (emphasis added). This could be interpreted by a court to mean that Prop 67 can‚Äôt be enforced.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> So even if Prop 67 passes, the statewide plastic bag ban could be struck down by 65. It's impossible to know that a court would interpret the language this way, but voters hoping to keep the plastic bag ban alive may not want to take the risk, and should vote No on 65.

				<div class="prop-title">Didn't we already do this?</div>
				<div class="prop-text"> California indeed passed the law to ban plastic bags, becoming the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-gov-brown-signs-phaseout-of-singleuse-plastic-bags-in-stores-20140929-story.html">first</a> state to do so. The ban was supposed to take effect in July 2015, but the American Progressive Bag Alliance gathered enough signatures to put the plastic bag ban to a <a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/25/news/california-plastic-bag-ban-delay/">vote</a> on this ballot (aka a referendum). 
				<br><br>
				If you're in one of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cawrecycles.org/list-of-local-bag-bans/">151</a> cities and counties across the state that have already banned plastic bags similar to how SB270 would, then Prop 67 can't change your local ban. If the statewide ban fails, local bans stay in effect. But because of what we said above, the number of Yes votes on 67 matter, so your vote is pretty damn important.
