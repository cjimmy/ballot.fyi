				<div class="prop-title">Summary</div>
				<div class="prop-text">This proposition, despite its many details, is straightforward, and has no surprise consequences. It raises the excise tax (a tax on a specific good) on tobacco products by $2.00 per pack, or equivalent. E-cigarettes, aka vaporizers, which are increasingly being used, are not currently taxed. If passed, this proposition would include e-cigarettes in the "other tobacco products" category, taxing it at $3.37. This new revenue would mostly go to services related to Medi-Cal, with 13% going to tobacco-related research and prevention programs.</div>

				</span><br><br>
				Compare this $2.87/pack to the high of New York's $4.35/pack tax or Texas' $1.41/pack.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> If Prop 56 passes, e-cigarettes would be lumped together with cigars and chew, making it subject to a $3.37 tax.
				</div>

				<div class="prop-title">And where's the money going to go?</div>
				<div class="prop-text">Excise taxes are used to get people to use less of a certain product. The point of the measure is to get less people to smoke, especially teens.<br><br>Because of that, revenue from the tax will ideally decrease over time, but tobacco-related healthcare costs will also decrease. This is intentional. The revenue gain from this tax is an estimated $1.3 billion next year.<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup><br><br>Those in opposition of this measure point to where this revenue will go, with the majority (% TBD, but roughly 80%) going to Medi-Cal related services, saying the money is going to "insurance companies and special interests." These opponents, funded primarily by <em>Philip Morris USA</em> and <em>RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company</em>, would prefer that the money actually went to addiction prevention.<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> Here's a more detailed<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=56&year=2016"> breakdown</a> of the revenue distribution in Figure 4 and 5.
				<br><br>
				Others oppose the measure because of the new taxation on e-cigarettes, which can act as a tool to quitting tobacco products.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2015/11/25/guest-commentary-vaping-isnt-the-same-as-tobacco-and-shouldnt-be-treated-as-such/">[..]</a></sup> The CDC is not super <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/ecigarette-ads/">keen</a> that kids are vaping though. No tobacco, but nicotine.
				<br><br>
				This measure has the second largest amount of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sacbee.com/site-services/databases/article72495842.html#CampaignFinance&!measures-featured">money</a> being spent on it, at close to $75 million.<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup> But you won't be fooled by the propaganda. You now know the facts.
