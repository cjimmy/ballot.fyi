The first site, published in early October 2016, reached about 1 million viewers in the its one month of relevance. Although the 2016 election will go down in history for its presidential election, California voters faced other large questions. Seventeen state propositions, ranging from legalizing marijuana to requiring porn stars to wear condoms, all made the ballot thanks to California's referendum system. If you voted in SF in 2016, you voted on 42 propositions (state + county) in total. Ballot.fyi aimed to simplify and explain the issues in a nonpartisan, nonboring way.

The site was hastily designed and put together by Jimmy Chion (me), and then edited heavily by friends left and right. It eventually looked and read alright. The net result was a voter guide that was widely shared, and subsequently led to a grant from The Knight Foundation to continue it in 2018.

## website
The website was developed with the help of a static site generator called Cactus (RIP). It spit out static html that could be deployed to AWS S3 with a click. How far we've come. I'm also a much better web dev now. This website is not worth cloning or forking.
